#Difference between compiler and interpreter.

(1)Compiler transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code, at once, before program runs, whereas an Interpreter coverts each high-level program statement, one by one, into the machine code, during program run.

(2)Compiled code runs faster while interpreted code runs slower.

(3)Compiler displays all errors after compilation, on the other hand, the Interpreter displays errors of each line one by one.

(4)Compiler is based on translation linking-loading model, whereas Interpreter is based on Interpretation Method.

(5)Compiler takes an entire program whereas the Interpreter takes a single line of code.
